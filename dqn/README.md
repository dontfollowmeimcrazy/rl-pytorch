# Deep Q-Learning (DQN) implementation for continuous action RL tasks

Based on the paper Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning [(link)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) by Minh et al. It is possible use also Double DQN [(link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461) to get better results and in shorter times.

Uses the OpenAI gym's environment `CartPole-v0` and the Atari games.. 

Model implementations include a MLP and a CNN + FC.

Use python 3. Can run also on a GPU.
