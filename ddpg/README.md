# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) implementation for continuous action RL tasks

Based on the paper Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning [(link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) by Lillicrap et al.

Uses the OpenAI gym's environment `LunarLander-v2` and the Mujoco environments. 

Model implementations include a MLPs for the Actor and the Critic.

Use python 3. Can run also on a GPU.
