# REINFORCE implementation for discrete action RL tasks

Based on the paper "Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning" [(link)](http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/williams92simple.pdf) by Williams et al. 

Uses the OpenAI gym's environment `CartPole-v0`. 

Model implementation is a simple feed forward neural network.

Use python 3. Can run also on a GPU.
